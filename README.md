Great! Since your project detects falls, objects, and fire from both videos and images, here's an updated and polished README.md text you can use for your GitHub repo. This version reflects all those capabilities clearly:

🔥🧍‍♂️ Fall, Fire & Object Detection using YOLOv5
This project uses YOLOv5, a powerful real-time object detection model, to detect falls, fire incidents, and various objects in both images and video streams. It’s designed for safety monitoring in public areas, elderly care, and smart surveillance systems.

📦 Dataset
Datasets were sourced and labeled for:

🧍‍♂️ Fall Detection – Includes images of people in falling postures.

🔥 Fire Detection – Includes labeled fire and non-fire scenarios.

🎯 Object Detection – General object categories for extended use cases.

Data is organized into:

train/: for training the model to recognize patterns.

valid/: for tuning during training.

test/: for final model evaluation.

The dataset is managed using a data.yaml file that lists class names and paths.
